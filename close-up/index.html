        <p class="text">My name is Jonah Raiford. And I would like to tell you why you should choose me to go to Close-Up. I understand the 3 branches but seeing them in real life would be cool. Another benefit is to see the monuments and relate them back to what I am learning in class. Reconstructing, slavery, etc. A good quote I have heard is, “a picture is worth a thousand words.” I think this will apply to a monument because I am seeing it. I am being in the present with the monument. Thank you for listening.</p>
